      <p> "localhost" is a web application that helps people find events, plan events, and invite participants. The goal of this project is to make public events more accessible and to make private events easier to share with your friends and family. Public events have an open invitation for which anyone can register, while the hosts of private events can send invitations to the guests they are looking to invite. Attendees of public events are allowed to “invite” other people as a way to notify those people that they are attending. Likewise, there is a master calendar that shows all of the upcoming public events in the user’s area. In this way, users can set event preferences and the app can automatically notify a user when there is an upcoming public event in which they might be interested. Events include a location, and there is a map where users can view events by their location. Currently, we are looking to expand the project idea to include not only campuses, but also in surrounding cities and towns. This project was built with an Oracle database and Flask as the back end and front end. These are connected with Oracle’s provided cx_Oracle python module.</p>
