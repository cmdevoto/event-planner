# Event Planning App Outstanding Items
---
This is a list of outstanding items that is separate from the new features to be built

Alternative name: all of the items we're slacking on 

1. Come up with an official name (unless All The Events is really what we're sticking with)
2. Add ability to call procedures to dbInterface
3. Redo login form to use Flask-WTF
4. Add Flask-Login for handling user-login stuff (and now that I'm thinking about it, maybe some pl/sql calls to figure out if a user is allowed to access a specific resource)
